# Arduino-Turret

To build the turret, I will use the following hardware components:

Arduino Uno (or any other 5V compatible model)
2x Servo motors (for vertical movement)
2x DC motors (for launching projectiles)
1x Motor for left-right movement (could be a DC motor or stepper motor)
1x Solenoid (for pushing projectiles into the motors that will launch them)
DC motor driver (e.g., L298N or L293D)
Stepper motor driver (if applicable)
Power supplies (for both Arduino and motors)
3D printer (to create the turret housing and projectiles)
Buttons or potentiometers (for manual control, if needed)
Resistors, transistors, diodes (for protection and circuit control)
Connecting wires and breadboard
